# MSMQ Handler
If you are working with Microsoft MSMQ messages, it's likely you have had trouble managing it properly.

This project aims to solve many problems we face day to day with Microsoft Message Queue
Some of the  main features are:

. View Message Queue List

. View Messages in a Message Queue

. Decode MSMQ Message

. Delete single or multiple msmq messages

. Update existing messages.


Note: At the moment this only works with private queues but it's easy to change it to work with both public and private queues.
